# Common Issues

Here are some common issues that users may encounter while working with the 'Widgetsy' library and their respective solutions:

- Widget not displaying properly: If the widget is not displaying as expected or appears broken, ensure that you have correctly imported the widget component and placed it within the appropriate container or component in your application. Double-check for any syntax errors or missing dependencies.

- Props not being applied: If the custom props, such as background gradient or rotation, are not being applied to the widgets, verify that you have correctly passed the props to the widget component. Check for any typos in the prop names and ensure that you are providing valid values.

- UI elements not responsive: If the UI elements within the widgets are not responsive or do not adapt to different screen sizes, ensure that you have applied appropriate CSS styles or CSS frameworks to make the widgets responsive. Consider using CSS media queries or responsive design techniques to ensure optimal usability on various devices.
