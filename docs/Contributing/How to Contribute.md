# How to Contribute

Contributions to the 'Widgetsy' library are welcome and greatly appreciated. By contributing, you can help improve the library and make it more robust and versatile. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Reporting Issues: If you encounter any bugs, glitches, or unexpected behavior while using the library, please report them on the issue tracker (see the Issue Tracker section for more details). When reporting an issue, provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any error messages or screenshots. This helps the maintainers to identify and resolve the problem effectively.

- Submitting Pull Requests: If you have identified an improvement, bug fix, or new feature that you would like to contribute, you can submit a pull request. Fork the repository, make the necessary changes in your fork, and then submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes you have made. The maintainers will review your contribution, provide feedback, and work with you to merge it into the main repository.

- Documentation Enhancements: You can also contribute by improving the documentation. This includes fixing typos, clarifying instructions, adding examples, or suggesting additional sections. Fork the repository, make the necessary changes to the documentation, and submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged.
