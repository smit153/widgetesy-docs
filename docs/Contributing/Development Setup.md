# Development Setup

To set up the development environment for contributing to the 'Widgetsy' library, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HrishabhCodes/widgetsy-npm
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash

yarn start
```

This will start the development server and allow you to view and test the widgets in a local development environment.

### Make Changes and Test

Make the necessary changes to the codebase and test them locally to ensure they work as expected. You can also run any available tests to verify that your changes have not introduced any regressions.

### Submit a Pull Request

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit your changes to a new branch and submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you have made, along with any relevant details or context.
