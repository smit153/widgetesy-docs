# Customization

The 'Widgetsy' library provides a range of customization options to tailor the appearance and behavior of the widgets according to your specific needs. This guide will walk you through the available customization features and how to utilize them effectively.

## Background

Background Gradient Customization: You can customize the background gradient of the widgets using the backgroundColor prop. This prop accepts an array of color stops, allowing you to create visually appealing gradients. Refer to the Props section in the Getting Started documentation for more details on how to specify the backgroundColor prop.

## Rotation

Rotation: The rotation feature allows you to adjust the rotation of the widgets in degrees. By modifying the rotation prop, you can achieve different orientations for the widgets. Ensure that the value provided for the rotation prop falls within the valid range of 0 to 360.

## Theme

Theme Selection: If you prefer a pre-built gradient for your widgets, you can use the theme prop. The theme prop accepts a value ranging from 0 to 5, representing different pre-defined gradient themes. Explore the Props section in the Getting Started documentation to learn more about utilizing the theme prop.
