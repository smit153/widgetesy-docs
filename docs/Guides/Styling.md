# Styling

To apply custom styles to the 'Widgetsy' widgets, you can leverage CSS and the provided class names. Here's a guide on how to style the widgets effectively:

## CSS Styling

CSS Styling: Use CSS to target the specific class names associated with the widgets' elements. You can inspect the widget components in your browser's developer tools to identify the class names used for each element. Apply your custom styles by targeting these class names in your CSS files.

## Override Default Styles

Override Default Styles: By applying your custom styles to the class names, you can override the default styles provided by the 'Widgetsy' library. This allows you to achieve a consistent look and feel with the rest of your application or tailor the widgets to match your desired design aesthetic.

you can refer to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HrishabhCodes/widgetsy-npm) guide for more details on the class names associated with each widget.

Remember to use CSS best practices and maintain the appropriate specificity when targeting the class names to ensure your custom styles are applied correctly.
